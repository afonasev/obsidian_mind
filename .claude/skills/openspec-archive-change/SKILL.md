Archive a completed change in the experimental workflow.

**Input**: Optionally specify a change name. If omitted, check if it can be inferred from conversation context. If vague or ambiguous you MUST prompt for available changes.

**Steps**

1. **If no change name provided, prompt for selection**

   Run `openspec list --json` to get available changes. Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** to let the user select.

   Show only active changes (not already archived).
   Include the schema used for each change if available.

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT guess or auto-select a change. Always let the user choose.

2. **Check artifact completion status**

   Run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json` to check artifact completion.

   Parse the JSON to understand:
   - `schemaName`: The workflow being used
   - `artifacts`: List of artifacts with their status (`done` or other)

   **If any artifacts are not `done`:**
   - Display warning listing incomplete artifacts
   - Use **AskUserQuestion tool** to confirm user wants to proceed
   - Proceed if user confirms

3. **Check task completion status**

   Read the tasks file (typically `tasks.md`) to check for incomplete tasks.

   Count tasks marked with `- [ ]` (incomplete) vs `- [x]` (complete).

   **If incomplete tasks found:**
   - Display warning showing count of incomplete tasks
   - Use **AskUserQuestion tool** to confirm user wants to proceed
   - Proceed if user confirms

   **If no tasks file exists:** Proceed without task-related warning.

4. **Assess delta spec state**

   Check for delta specs at `openspec/changes/<name>/specs/`. If none exist, note "No delta specs" for the summary.

   **If delta specs exist:**
   - Compare each delta spec with its corresponding main spec at `openspec/specs/<capability>/spec.md`
   - Determine what changes will be applied (adds, modifications, removals, renames)
   - Show a combined summary

   This is **informational only** — the merge into main specs is performed programmatically by `openspec archive` in the next step. Do NOT invoke the agent-driven `openspec-sync-specs` skill here; the CLI handles the delta format natively and is far faster. (Use `openspec-sync-specs` only for standalone mid-flight syncing outside of archiving.)

5. **Perform the archive**

   Run the openspec CLI. It merges delta specs into main specs programmatically, validates, and moves the change to `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>`:

   ```bash
   openspec archive <name> -y
   ```

   For infrastructure/tooling/doc-only changes with no specs to merge, add `--skip-specs`.

   If the command fails because the target archive directory already exists, suggest renaming the existing archive or using a different date.

6. **Auto-commit and push the archive**

   - Run `git status` + `git diff` to see what `openspec archive` changed (the merged main specs and the moved change directory).
   - If there is nothing to commit, skip the commit and push; report "Nothing to commit".
   - Otherwise stage the relevant changed/untracked files explicitly by path (never `git add -A`/`.`; skip `.env`, secrets, large binaries).
   - Create a single commit using the standard project format with a HEREDOC body, ending with the `Co-Authored-By` trailer required by the global commit protocol. Subject: `<change-name>: archive`.
   - After a successful commit, push with `git push` (the current branch tracks `origin/main`; if no upstream yet, use `git push -u origin <current-branch>`). If no remote is configured, skip the push and note "No remote configured" — do not fail the archive.
   - Do NOT use `--no-verify` or `--amend`. If the pre-commit or pre-push hook fails, report the failure and stop — do not retry blindly or auto-bypass hooks.
   - Do NOT ask the user for confirmation.

7. **Display summary**

   Show archive completion summary including:
   - Change name
   - Schema that was used
   - Archive location
   - Whether specs were synced (if applicable)
   - Push status (pushed to `origin/main` / nothing to commit / no remote / hook failed)
   - Note about any warnings (incomplete artifacts/tasks)

**Output On Success**

```
## Archive Complete

**Change:** <change-name>
**Schema:** <schema-name>
**Archived to:** openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/
**Specs:** ✓ Synced to main specs (or "No delta specs" or "Sync skipped")
**Pushed:** ✓ origin/main

All artifacts complete. All tasks complete.
```

**Guardrails**
- Always prompt for change selection if not provided
- Use artifact graph (openspec status --json) for completion checking
- Don't block archive on warnings - just inform and confirm
- Show clear summary of what happened
- Let `openspec archive` perform both the spec merge and the directory move — do not mkdir/mv by hand, and do not pre-sync with the agent-driven `openspec-sync-specs` skill.
- After archiving, commit and push the result; never auto-bypass a failing pre-commit/pre-push hook.
